# Example

In this example we will set up a dimmable light and a humidity sensor (both using fake data, of course). Both working examples can be found in [here](https://github.com/mozilla-iot/webthing-java/tree/master/src/main/java/org/mozilla/iot/webthing/example).

## Dimmable Light

Imagine you have a dimmable Light that you want to expose via the web of things API. The Light can be turned on/off and the brightness can be set from 0% to 100%. Besides the name, description, and type, a `dimmableLight` is required to expose two properties:
* `on`: the state of the light, whether it is turned on or off
    * Setting this property via a `PUT {"on": true/false}` call to the REST API toggles the light.
* `level`: the brightness level of the light from 0-100%
    * Setting this property via a PUT call to the REST API sets the brightness level of this light.

First we create a new Thing:

```java
Thing light = new Thing("My Lamp", "dimmableLight", "A web connected lamp");
```

Now we can add the required properties.

The **`on`** property reports and sets the on/off state of the light. For this, we need to have a `Value` Object which holds the actual state and also how to turn the light on/off. For our purposes, we just want to log the new state if the light is switched on/off.

```java
Map<String, Object> onDescription = new HashMap<>();
onDescription.put("type", "boolean");
onDescription.put("description", "Whether the lamp is turned on");

Value<Boolean> on = new Value<>(true,
                                // Here, you could send a signal to
                                // the GPIO that switches the lamp
                                // off
                                v -> System.out.printf(
                                        "On-State is now %s\n",
                                        v));

light.addProperty(new Property(light, "on", on, onDescription));
```

The **`level`** property reports the brightness level of the light and sets the level. Like before, instead of actually setting the level of a light, we just log the level to std::out.

```java
Map<String, Object> levelDescription = new HashMap<>();
levelDescription.put("type", "number");
levelDescription.put("description", "The level of light from 0-100");
levelDescription.put("minimum", 0);
levelDescription.put("maximum", 100);

Value<Double> level = new Value<>(0.0,
                                  // Here, you could send a signal
                                  // to the GPIO that controls the
                                  // brightness
                                  l -> System.out.printf(
                                          "New light level is %s",
                                          l));

light.addProperty(new Property(light, "level", level, levelDescription));
```

Now we can add our newly created thing to the server and start it:

```java
try {
    List<Thing> things = new ArrayList<>();
    things.add(light);

    // If adding more than one thing here, be sure to set the second
    // parameter to some string, which will be broadcast via mDNS.
    // In the single thing case, the thing's name will be broadcast.
    WebThingServer server =
            new WebThingServer(things, "LightAndTempDevice", 8888);

    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() {
        public void run() {
            server.stop();
        }
    });

    server.start(false);
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e);
    System.exit(1);
}
```

This will start the server, making the light available via the WoT REST API and announcing it as a discoverable resource on your local network via mDNS.

## Sensor

Let's now also connect a humidity sensor to the server we set up for our light.

A `multiLevelSensor` (a sensor that can also return a level instead of just true/false) has two required properties (besides the name, type, and  optional description): **`on`** and **`level`**. We want to monitor those properties and get notified if the value changes.

First we create a new Thing:

```java
Thing sensor = new Thing("My Humidity Sensor",
                         "multiLevelSensor",
                         "A web connected humidity sensor");
```

Then we create and add the appropriate properties:
* `on`: tells us whether the sensor is on (i.e. high), or off (i.e. low)

    ```java
    Map<String, Object> onDescription = new HashMap<>();
    onDescription.put("type", "boolean");
    onDescription.put("description", "Whether the sensor is on");

    Value<Boolean> on = new Value<>(true);

    sensor.addProperty(new Property(sensor, "on", on, onDescription));
    ```

* `level`: tells us what the sensor is actually reading
    * Contrary to the light, the value cannot be set via an API call, as it wouldn't make much sense, to SET what a sensor is reading. Therefore, we are utilizing a *readOnly* Value by omitting the `valueForwarder` parameter.

    ```java
    Map<String, Object> levelDescription = new HashMap<>();
    levelDescription.put("type", "number");
    levelDescription.put("description", "The current humidity in %");
    levelDescription.put("unit", "%");

    this.level = new Value<>(0.0);

    sensor.addProperty(new Property(sensor, "level", level, levelDescription));
    ```

Now we have a sensor that constantly reports 0%. To make it usable, we need a thread or some kind of input when the sensor has a new reading available. For this purpose we start a thread that queries the physical sensor every few seconds. For our purposes, it just calls a fake method.

```java
// Start a thread that polls the sensor reading every 3 seconds
new Thread(()->{
    while(true){
        try {
            Thread.sleep(3000);
            // Spdates the underlying value, which in turn notifies all
            // listeners
            this.level.notifyOfExternalUpdate(readFromGPIO());
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(e);
        }
    }
}).start();
```

This will update our `Value` object with the sensor readings via the `this.level.notifyOfExternalUpdate(readFromGPIO());` call. The `Value` object now notifies the property and the thing that the value has changed, which in turn notifies all websocket listeners.
